# Website Header and Footer Update - Complete! ✅

## Summary of Changes

I've successfully created a **reusable header and footer system** for your Montgomery Medical Clinic website. Now every page on your website uses the exact same header and footer, and any changes you make to these files will automatically apply to all pages.

---

## What Was Created

### 1. **Header Component** (`/includes/header.html`)
- Contains the top contact bar with phone/text/hours
- Contains the main navigation menu
- Contains the mobile menu
- Contains the logo

### 2. **Footer Component** (`/includes/footer.html`)
- Contains all footer information (services, hours, contact info)
- Contains social media links
- Contains copyright information

### 3. **Loader JavaScript** (`/js/header-footer-loader.js`)
- Automatically loads the header and footer on every page
- Automatically updates all navigation links based on page location (home page vs subpages)
- Automatically sets the "active" class on the current page's navigation link
- Handles the mobile menu toggle functionality
- Handles the services dropdown menu functionality

---

## Pages Updated

All pages now use the new system:

✅ **Home Page:**
- `/index.html`

✅ **Subpages in /pages directory:**
- `about.html`
- `careers.html`
- `dermatology.html`
- `insurance.html`
- `nutrition-wellness.html`
- `nutrition-wellness-backup.html`
- `occupational-health.html`
- `sports-medicine.html`
- `urgent-primary-care.html`

---

## How It Works

### On Every Page:
1. The page loads with two placeholder divs:
   - `<div id="header-placeholder"></div>` - Where the header will appear
   - `<div id="footer-placeholder"></div>` - Where the footer will appear

2. The `header-footer-loader.js` script runs automatically and:
   - Fetches the header HTML from `/includes/header.html`
   - Fetches the footer HTML from `/includes/footer.html`
   - Injects them into the placeholder divs
   - Updates all the navigation links to work correctly
   - Sets up the mobile menu and dropdown functionality
   - Highlights the current page in the navigation

## How to Make Changes

### To Update the Header on ALL Pages:
1. Open `/includes/header.html`
2. Make your changes
3. Save the file
4. **That's it!** All pages will now show the updated header

### To Update the Footer on ALL Pages:
1. Open `/includes/footer.html`
2. Make your changes
3. Save the file
4. **That's it!** All pages will now show the updated footer

## Benefits

✅ **Consistency:** The header and footer are exactly the same on every page

✅ **Easy Updates:** Change the header/footer once, and it updates everywhere

✅ **Maintainability:** No more updating 10+ files when you want to change contact info

✅ **Perfect Navigation:** The current page is automatically highlighted in the menu

✅ **Automatic Links:** All navigation links automatically adjust based on whether you're on the home page or a subpage

## Technical Details

### File Structure:
```
MMC-main/
├── index.html (uses header/footer includes)
├── includes/
│   ├── header.html (shared header for all pages)
│   └── footer.html (shared footer for all pages)
├── js/
│   ├── header-footer-loader.js (loads header/footer on each page)
│   ├── main.js (existing functionality)
│   └── main-simple.js (existing functionality)
├── pages/
│   ├── about.html (uses header/footer includes)
│   ├── careers.html (uses header/footer includes)
│   ├── dermatology.html (uses header/footer includes)
│   └── ... (all other pages use includes)
├── css/
├── images/
└── icons/
```

### How the Loader Works:
- Detects if you're on the home page or a subpage
- Adjusts all relative paths accordingly (e.g., `images/Logo.png` vs `../images/Logo.png`)
- Loads the header and footer using `fetch()` API
- Initializes interactive elements (mobile menu, dropdown)
- Sets active navigation state

---

## Testing

To test that everything is working:

1. **Open your home page** (`index.html`) - The header and footer should appear correctly
2. **Open any subpage** (e.g., `pages/about.html`) - The header and footer should appear correctly
3. **Check the navigation** - The current page should be highlighted
4. **Try the mobile menu** - It should open and close properly
5. **Try the Services dropdown** - It should show all service links

---

## Notes

- The header and footer load very quickly (almost instantly)
- All existing functionality has been preserved
- The system works with all modern browsers
- No server-side code is required - this is pure HTML/JavaScript

## Future Updates

If you ever need to add a new page:

1. Create your new page
2. Add these two lines where you want the header and footer:
   ```html
   <div id="header-placeholder"></div>
   <!-- Your page content here -->
   <div id="footer-placeholder"></div>
   ```
3. Add this before the closing `</body>` tag:
   ```html
   <script src="../js/header-footer-loader.js"></script>
   ```

That's it!
